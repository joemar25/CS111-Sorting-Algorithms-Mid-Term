# CS111 Mid Term Project

This project is intended to give the proper calculations for time effiency of the Sorting Algorithms (Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).

## The Program's Behaviour and Features
- User is asked for N values
- Generates N integers which are either Randomly and Sorted (in increasing order)
- Sorts the values using different Algorithms
- Output a file containing the T(n) that spends on using the different algorithms for sorting and the generated N integers (original and sorted)
- The sorting algorithms are implemented on different functions
- Use `#include <ctime>` header to use `clock()` function on helping us to calculate the T(n)
- Note: `#include <time.h>` is same as `#include <ctime>`
`Extra`
- User has the choice if he/she want to use randomly generated values or the sorted increasing order at the start of the program - So there is no need for the user to modify the code to alter the results
- Input checker if value <= 0, preventing errors and check if it exceeds the MAXIMUM VALUE
- Uses only the standard functions to work on multiple platforms
	Programming Language used: C++

## Implementation
Code for hello:

```c++
cout << "Hello";
```
